            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>It all started with a paddle, a dream, and a wild stretch of river.
                WildFlow Adventures was born from a group of friends who believed that nature wasn’t just a place to visit — it was a place to truly feel alive. What began as weekend trips down the roaring rapids became a mission to share that thrill with the world.
                We launched our first guided rafting trip with a borrowed raft, a handful of life vests, and a lot of passion. Word spread quickly — not just about the adventure, but about the care we showed our guests and the respect we had for every bend in the river.
                Today, WildFlow Adventures is more than a rafting company. It’s a community of explorers, families, and first-time paddlers who come together to experience the magic of the outdoors — safely, joyfully, and responsibly.
                And every time someone screams with excitement on a rapid or laughs under a waterfall, we’re reminded why we started:
                To help people ride the river — and rediscover their wild.
